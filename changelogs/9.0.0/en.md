## New Reminder Types Are Available! ⏰

**Version 9.0.0** introduces three new reminder types to help you stay on top of your tracking:

* **Periodic Reminders**: Set reminders that repeat at regular intervals (e.g., every 3 days, every 2 weeks).
* **Month Day Reminders**: Set reminders for specific days of the month (e.g. the first Monday or last Friday of each month).
* **Time Since Last**: Set reminders based on the time elapsed since you last tracked a specific item. (These also work with functions provided your function only produces data points when you track something).

## Additional Improvements ✨

* You can now duplicate existing reminders to quickly create similar ones. ➕
* The Reminder UI has been improved for better usability and clarity. 🎨
* Reminders are now more robust and will notify you of any missed reminders (e.g., if your device was off when the reminder was supposed to trigger). 🔔

## Minor Fixes and Improvements 🔧

* Fixed an issue where monthly bar charts were assigning data points to the wrong months. 📊
* Child items in the select item dialog are now sorted case insensitively for better organization. 🔤
* Improved elevation and ripple effects when dragging cards in group view for a smoother experience. 😍
