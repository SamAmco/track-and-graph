Track & Graph: Dashboards for life

Track & Graph helps you record, visualize, and understand patterns in your daily life. Record numerical values or simple occurrences to build personal dashboards that provide insights into your habits, behaviors, and activities.

Visualize your data through line graphs, pie charts, and statistical reports that show trends, moving averages, and intervals between events. Organize tracking items into customizable groups that make sense for your needs.

Track & Graph now embeds a Lua scripting API, allowing you to create custom calculations (like cumulative totals, differentials, or financial metrics).

Track & Graph is completely free and open source with no ads, accounts, or in-app purchases. Your data remains private—stored only on your device—and can be easily backed up at any time.
