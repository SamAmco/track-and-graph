# Importing and exporting

### CSV Import & Export

To import/export only the tracked data in a group to a CSV use the menu buttons at the top:

!["faq_2_1"](images/faq_2_1.png){ width="300" }

!["faq_2_2"](images/faq_2_2.png)

Use this button to import a csv into this group.

!["faq_2_3"](images/faq_2_3.png)

Use this button to export this groups tracked data to a csv.

### Backup & Restore

The Backup & Restore option in the menu is slightly different. This will export and restore the entire database file containing all tracked data, graphs, reminders and notes. 

**It is recommended that you backup your data regularly or configure the auto-backup option.**

The backup file is an un-encrypted Sqlite3 database file which can also be opened and modified using freely available software. However this is not recommended for non-technical users as you could break the integrity of the database.
