-- Although Lua has built-in math.random and math.randomseed functions, the stability of those 
-- generated numbers across different Lua versions and platforms is not guaranteed.
-- Also the current Lua engine implementation supports only a single 32 bit seed, which
-- can be tricky to work with if you are trying to seed from an epoch milliseconds timestamp
-- (as is common in TnG)
--
-- Therefore, we provide our own Random class for stable performant random number generation
-- based on the Xoroshiro128+ algorithm.
--
-- One added benefit is that multiple Random instances can be created with different seeds,
-- allowing for independent random number streams.
