- Verify the configuration links are correct in ./configuration/remote-configuration.json

- Run `make validate-remote-config`

- Run the community tests `make run-community-tests`

- Update the build.gradle version code and name

- Build an apk for the release (using Android Studio) and install it to sense check the release build

- Copy and paste a fastlane changelog file and add the changelog there e.g. 

cp fastlane/metadata/android/en-GB/changelogs/10403.txt fastlane/metadata/android/en-GB/changelogs/10404.txt

- Build an aab for the release (using Android Studio)

also make sure you update any other fastlane resources you want proliferated e.g. screenshots or app description.

- Use fastlane to upload the new aab to the play store e.g. for alpha:

bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/release/app-release.aab --track alpha

for beta:

bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/release/app-release.aab --track beta

or for release:

bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/release/app-release.aab --rollout 0.5

- Commit everything

- Tag the commit e.g. rc-v1.0.0 for release candidate or v1.0.0 for release (you only want to tag once google play has accepted the upload) as F-droid uses these tags for its own releases

- On GitHub create a new release using the new tag and attatch the apk to it. Also copy the release notes in here.
