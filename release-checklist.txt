- Run `make validate-all` or `make validate-remote-config` and `make run-community-tests`

- Update the build.gradle version code and name

(also make sure you update any other fastlane resources you want proliferated e.g. screenshots or app description.)

- Run `make changelog` to generate a changelog from merged commits since the last release

- Run `make commit-version` to commit the version bump and changelog (before release to ensure reproducible builds)

- Run `make assemble-bundle-release` or `make assemble-release` and `make bundle-release` to generate the apk and aab

- Run the app on a device to sanity check the release build `adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

- Use fastlane to upload the new aab to the play store e.g. for alpha:

bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --track alpha

for beta:

bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --track beta

or for release:

bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --rollout 0.5

- run `make github-release` to create a new github release with the changelog and apk attached
