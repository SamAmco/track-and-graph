So for example if you only ever read on Fridays you would expect your histogram to only show one bar for Friday with height 1.</p> <p></p> <p>If you read on Saturday 50% of the time and on Friday 50% of the time you would expect your histogram to look like this:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"tutorial/graphs/histograms/#working-with-labeled-data","title":"Working with Labeled Data","text":"<p>If the data you are tracking has labels then Track &amp; Graph will show you the distribution within each bar of the amount made up by each label tracked like so:</p> <p></p> <p>By default the height of each bar is relative to the sum of all the data point values that fall in that time range.
