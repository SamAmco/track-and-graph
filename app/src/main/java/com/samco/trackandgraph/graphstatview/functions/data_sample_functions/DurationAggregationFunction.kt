/**
 * Add up all data points per plotTotalTime. For example if the plot total time is 1 day and the
 * sample data contains 3 data points {1, 3, 7} all tracked on the same day then the function will
 * return a data sample containing 1 point with the value 11.
 *
 * The timestamp of each generated data point will be one nanosecond before the end of that [binSize]
 * period. For example if the [binSize] is one week and the [timeHelper] specifies [TimeHelper.findEndOfTemporal]
 * for one week to be at 00:00 on a Monday then each generated data point will have a timestamp
 * of the last nanosecond of the preceding Sunday.
 *
 * The currently supported [binSize] values are: Duration.ofHours(1), Period.ofDays(1),
 * Period.ofWeeks(1), Period.ofMonths(1), Period.ofYears(1)
 *
 * sampleData.dataPoints should be sorted from oldest timestamp to newest timestamp
