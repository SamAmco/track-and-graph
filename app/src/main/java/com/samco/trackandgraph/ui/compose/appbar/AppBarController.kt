     * Publishes [newConfig] for [destination] when (and only when) that destination is the current

     *
     * Why this exists:
     * Navigation 3 keeps entry content alive during transitions. If the user navigates A → B and then
     * quickly back to A before the transition completes, A may not recompose on return. Relying on
     * composition alone to update the app bar can leave it showing B’s config.
     *
     * Approach:
     * Observe the back stack (top entry) and gate the write on `backStack.lastOrNull() == destination`.
     * This ensures only the foreground entry updates the app bar and avoids stale writes from an
     * exiting screen, even under rapid forward/back navigation.
